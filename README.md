Created this E-Commerce Website as part of a Project.

This is a fictional webstore, selling mostly fictional items. A variety of web technologies were used to implement a shopping cart, product pages, user/admin accounts, keep track of orders, keep track of account balances, and process sales using a fictional currency.
